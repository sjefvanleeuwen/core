## Discipl Core

Discipl focuses on an evolved society in a needs based economy (a network economy of abundance / resource based economy) and tries to progress society to this by underpinning
society with a DIstributed Collaborative Information PLatform. Needs (both demand and supply) are expressed anonymously by entities (people and things) and taken
care of automaticly and for free as much as possible following law, regulations and policies, which contain the previously established solutions for conflicting needs. Conflicts are taken
care of through timely and efficient convergent facilitation processes, possible at multiple levels and which is mostly a human-guided dialogue between stakeholders.
As a last resort conflicts can put to an end at the level of judicature. These processes can lead to alteration in policies and even law and regulations and therefore the automated servicing of needs. This is what we call the Discipl Pattern. An embedded agile "polder-model" 3.0, based upon a better consensus model that takes everyone seriously.

We care about all beings deeply no matter their peculiarities, capabillities or beliefs and so on. We attend to the non controversial essence of the needs of all where possible but are always confident we can find solutions that work for all. We think organisations (both non-profit as for-profit sector) can progress to this future by embracing the Discipl Manifesto:

1 We create sustainable, highly automated solutions that fulfil peopleâ€™s needs;  
2 Solutions can be produced and installed relatively simply for (free of charge) use;  
3 Solutions are open source, having a Creative Commons licence or a GPL version 3.01;  
4 Solutions apply the Discipl Pattern;  
5 We respect the current legal frameworks  

There's a lot to do to make this work, even as proof of concept. The current world is not really incentivised to make this happen, though the transition harbours great opportunities for conservative entities finding security in holding on to this "old" world too. To experiment with the required technology we are creating a reference implementation of a software stack that could bootstrap this new world.

Discipl Core is the most bottom layer of this stack, implementing vendor independent (both personal as distributed) storage, self sovereign identification and authentication functionalities. It provides a single context dependent source of verifiable linked data channels kept in any platform that can hold such data (every platform with it's own specific characteristics), and
use those platforms in a hybrid way.

On itself, Discipl Core is an innovative project that focuses on communication through personal claims of self sovereign entities as a lean and simple to use technology that is the result of combining Linked Data, Open Data, Open Government, Verifiable Credentials and Distributed Ledger concepts and trends without trying to reinvent wheels. Discipl Core is not a platform intended to rule them all, but it can be really handy when you need to support multiple platforms, make your
users able to choose their own type of platform or wallet (if there are multiple to choose from that provide sufficient functionality: you decide). It can make your solution platform and vendor independent, make data portable (migrate from one to the other) and so on. You could even connect with legacy systems in the same way.

Note the absence of smart contracts. Smart contracts are just automated responses for actors on the platforms that support smart contracts; where a platform supports maintaining a single truth, you can make all logic executed at client devices instead of executing this redundantly on all nodes that form the platform's infrastructure. It is analog to database programming: you don't need it, though of course you could use it, using the platform as a cloud. With the Discipl Pattern, we envision laws expressed in natural language sufficiently labeled to be interpreted as code (Law as code instead of Code as law). Decisions are never done by computers or AI. We hold on to an open world assumption and this means holding on to the assumption that reality is more complex than you can describe in laws or code. Judicature already knows this (or it should). Big Data is almost always biased too. We hold on to the established concept in that we resolve conflicts with mutual agreements which all stakeholders genuinely accept, via real dialogue about the non controversial essence of what drives us in our opinions and beliefs. When there's no conflict in needs, then there's nothing to resolve or to do for humans other than automating it.

Why you would use Discipl Core?

For instance: you can maintain, retrieve information on all supported (and suitable) platforms and have people use their verifiable credentials solution of their own choice within a single implementation. This is handy for instance when giving tourists reduction or vote rights in return of attesting their stay at hoteliers that also can choose their own platform and method of identifying for enrolling in such service as it would allow them to pay their taxes (we all should have agreed with as being part of the community of this country) in a more convenient automated way. One of these tourists could be a teacher from Amsterdam who after expressing his need for self actualisation would have automatically found and enrolled in getting a benefit specifically applicable for his situation. He would be able to easily exchange it's old Diesel car for an e-bike using a special one time grant after his drivers license was revoked due to having problems with his sight, a decision he does not accept however so a process could be started to handle this conflict automaticly. It would also enable free open anonymous statistics with which more can be done in other use cases. It would probably give rise to open decentralised free marketplaces and social media. All this using Discipl (or compatible apps; everyone can build upon it for free).

But this is peanuts compared to what we're aiming at. Taxes, benefits, grants, all things money; in the end all this will not be neccasary in the society we envision. It is experimental too though and is AS IS. Use it as you like. We never promised you a rose garden.

Enough mumbo jumbo ? ;-)

## The Discipl Core API

This API is a javascript ES6 module intended for client side usage. It is intended to run in NodeJS, React Native (through expo.io) and JS engines in webbrowsers. With it you can let actors create self sovereign id's, let them make claims about themselves, attest claims of others, verify claim attestations and possibly revoke claims. The self sovereign id is a string with DID syntax (https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/draft-documents/did-primer.md) denoting a supported platform which is any platform that supports storing claims in relation to a public id, contained in the DID, and enforces that only a holder of a corresponding private key can make claims in relation to that id. The claims in relation to a particular DID form a channel and can link to claims in other channels. These claims are attestations. The API contains a method to see whether a particular claim is attested by one or more particular other DID's. Further it contains functions to retrieve claims in channels, monitor channels and even traverse or fetch all data in the linked channels.

In essence the API is therefore a linked data client that can crawl over all used and supported platforms that attestations link to. Doing so it can export or you can traverse a linked data set for all kinds of processing like feeding a dashboard based on R with discipl-R. There are a lot of platforms that can be used: distributed public ledgers, permissioned ledgers but also more private self sovereign identity / verifiable claims or verifiable credentials solutions. The specifics of the platform used determines how safe it is to put what kind of information in claims and what functionality is available. So note that discipl core does not prohibit you to put sensitive information in public if you choose the wrong platform. Note that self sovereign identities are meant to be relatively short lived and it's usage bounded by a use case to prevent privacy issues because of linkabillity, even with seemingly anonymous information.

Discipl Core is meant to be lean and simple and it does not impose usage of metadata on data. It only enforces and therefore structures linked data to have always self sovereign id's as subject of the linked data triples and that the holder of a private key related to this self sovereign id as public key is the only one that can store such triples, we call claims. It therefore wil not neccasarily comply fully with standards like the verifiable credentials specification but will follow it's own path as it's usage is more broad than only verifiable credentials. It may provide access to functionality provided by platforms that do comply with the verifiable crendentials standards.


## Terminology

term | description
--- | ---
*self sovereign id* | A random identifier an actor chooses/generates for him/herself to refer to him/herself in subsequent communication. This identifier mostly is a public key belonging to a private key the holder of that key can use to make claims exclusively in relation to this self sovereign id. Within Discipl Core we use a DID like syntax for this identifier so when referring to the "DID" of an actor we also mean this self sovereign id of the actor. Note that self sovereign identities are meant to be relatively short lived and bounded by use case.
*claim* | One or more subject-predicate-object triples, typically stored as JSON-LD with no metadata where the subject is always the DID (or reference to this in the form of "I") of the actor that created the claim. The predicate is any string and required. The object, a string, is optional.
*channel* | Set of claims with the same object (same DID)
*attestation* | A claim with a link to some other claim (could be a claim with the same subject, thus in the same channel).
*link* | The link is either a platform specific reference (if the platforms supports that and it's immutabillity is to be trusted, or it is intended to be mutable), or it can contain a proof, for instance a peppered hash (HMAC-386) of (multiple) predicate-object parts of the claim with the object (a DID) as key. This DID is to be kept off ledger then by the way. So to be able to verify such proofs, you'll need to know at forehand the whole claim being attested and thus know the actual link (or you'll probably have to do a lot of work), but the proof does define a link to some otherwise unreferencable piece of information. In most cases you would get the claim being referenced from the actor that made the claim. Do not mistake a link by proof with a verifiable claim/credential for sensitive data though, on itself, it is not intended nor safe for this usage as for instance peppered hashes are not considered good enough as an anonymisation technique. The proof is intended to verify a link to a given piece of information in the underlying platform this information is stored in. The proof in these links is platform specific and may not be suitable to be stored on ledgers.<br><br>A reference can be a specific reference to a logged transaction the claim was stored with, or it can be the DID, referencing the first claim in the corresponding channel. Platforms may have limited functionality. The link always denotes the platform and does this by using a notation similair to the DID notation. Examples:<br>- *link by reference (of a DID or transaction)* : link:discipl:iotaDJI99DSKNSNDL99WDSDNSDNLLWNWNWQQNLSDNSDN9SD999SDSDNKNJSND9DSHPLVZ<br>- *link by proof* : link:discipl:zenroomLIwew77897wer[=87s9ydh]sd999sdnkLIJEOJJ#*Y*YOjjjhskds93k4n3knk9fs<br>(above examples are just an indication)
*platform* | Any operational technology capable of storing/retrieving claims in relation to self sovereign id's
*linked data export* | Given a DID, one can export all claims of that DID and all claims in channels with claims linked by reference in those claims and all claims in channels with claims referenced in those claims and so on. Stopping at circulair references one can export or iteratively traverse a whole dataset. Note that a separate DID should be used for a single proces in a single use case which should make the dataset limited. Dependent on the use case it can become fairly big though.

## supported platforms

Many platforms can be supported to become part of the discipl platform. We distinguish the following platform types:

- local wallet 	: platforms that store claims in local wallets within platform specific apps or platforms that are implemented as libraries for local storage of claims
- public ledger	: permissionless public distributed ledgers.
- hybrid 			: permissionless public distributed platforms that combine both public ledger as local wallet platform type of functionality
- hybrid managed	: permissioned, centrally managed distributed ledgers that might be GDPR compliant enough to store sensitive data in.

At the moment just a few have initial implementations, most are planned, others desired. All these supported platforms have their own connector repository. Platform connectors implement the connector interface defined here.

Platform		| Type 				| Status		| Connector Repository			| Usable for PII | duration	| requires node | Remarks
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Memory			| local wallet		| implemented	| discipl-core-mem				| yes			 | <0.1s	| no, only local| You must add memory protection yourselves, just a local store of claims in memory as long as process it is used in runs.

legacy			| hybrid managed	| planned		| discipl-core-legacy			| possible		 | depends	| yes, manual 	| Interfaces with legacy datasources that implement REST interface.

Note this library and all connectors are in early experimental development. Do not use in production (yet).

## Basic Usage

This ES6 module will export the main interface to use discipl-core. It will automaticly require modules when needed. Of course it doesn't install them for you so make sure all connector modules for platforms you want to support are installed. Make sure you configure the connector modules within your code before using the discipl core api or rely on the default operation that the connector uses a discipl node (here). By default, this library expects a local discipl node but you will be able to set a custom URL. The platforms that are made available through this node will be automaticly required and configured.

Where needed you create a self sovereign identity for a given platform, mainly consisting of a public-private key where the public key is contained in a correspondig DID. You are responsible for persisting these keys yourself if neccasary. If you want to use a previously created identity, you must set it. Sometimes however, you do not have to set a identity for instance if you are only going to read information from a public platform.

Note that self sovereign identities are meant to be relatively short lived and bounded by use case. The discipl-4sacan and discipl-law-reg modules are intended to be able to automaticly create ssid's for actors bounded by the actor's usage of use cases within published law and regulations and can let actors choose a connector to keep them safe and automaticly remembered when needed.

## Installation

Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm, however npm gets updated more frequently than node does, so you'll want to make sure it's the latest version.
```

sudo npm install npm -g
```
clone the discipl-core repository
```
git clone git@github.com:discipl/core.git
```
Switch to core directory

```
npm install
```

then in your NodeJS script:

```
const discipl = require('discipl-core')
const ssid = discipl.newSsid('iota')
discipl.claim(ssid, {'need':'beer'}).then(console.log).catch(console.log)
```

Most methods are asynchronous so will return Promises, something which we prefer over using callbacks.

See examples folder for more example code (coming soon)

## API

### `getConnector`
Loads and retrieves the discipl connector object with the given name. You only need this when you'll have to configure it differently than as is done by default before doing other actions with this API. The name 'ipv8' would load and return the discipl-core-ipv8 connector. It throws an error if it does not succeed in this.

```
getConnector(name)
```

### `newSsid`
Generates a new ssid, a JSON object in the form of: {connector:connectorObj, did:did, pubkey:pubkey, privkey:privkey}, for the platform the given discipl connector name adds support for.
This action will open up a channel tied to this DID on the platform. Nobody will probably know about this
however until a first claim is published publicly (depends on platform). The connector name should be given as argument.
By default this is to be the same as the part after "discipl-core-" in the name of the connector repository in github. So for instance, for IOTA it is "iota" (lowercase).
connectors may store extra information in this object but you'll never have to care about this. Setting the private key is also only required when making a claim of course.

```
newSsid(connector)
```

### `claim`
Adds a claim with the given data in it to the channel of the given ssid. The given data should be a JSON object with a list of key:value pairs in which the keys are predicates and the values the objects. A connector also stores this in a nested way as one JSON data object. Note: you will not be able to reference, attest and thus verify single nested claims. Storing a claim on a platform can take some time, dependent on the platform used. Therefore this method is asynchronous and returns a promise. If no error occurred, the resolve function receives a link to the new claim as result. This link can be used in other claims (in channels of other Ssids for instance) as attestation.

```
async claim(ssid, data)
```

###	`attest`
Creates a simple attestation using a given predicate and link. In itself this is the same as making the given ssid make a claim that includes the given link. It is a shorthand for: claim(ssid, {predicate:link}, ...). See also the description at the claim method. To make more complex attestations, holding extra information in relation to the attestation, you can simply use the claim method with links as objects in relation to given predicates.

```
async attest(ssid, predicate, link)
```

### `verify`
Let's you verify whether a given claim is attested by one of a given set of actors (as identified through the given ssid's) using the given predicate and returns true if so. You can also just give one ssid instead of a list. This method returns false if either the claim or all matching attestations are revoked.

```
async verify(link, predicate, ssids[])
```

### `get`
Returns the claim in a JSON-LD object the given link links to. This object also includes a link to the previous claim in the channel if it exists. The ssid object is optional but may be needed if the information retrieval is permissioned in which case the ssid is used for identification. The return value has the form: {data:claimdata, previous:prevlink}.

```
async get(link, (ssid))
```

### `exportLD`

Exports linked claim data, starting at the first claim in the channel of the given DID, SSID or at the claim referenced in the given link, following links to other channels which get exported in a nested dataset also and so on. So, when giving a DID or SSID, the whole channel is read. When giving a link to a claim, only that claim is processed. The export stops at circular references or at the given depth level. You can use this method again to expand the exported dataset even further. Just as like with the get() method, retrieving infrormation that is permissioned may require identification for which the given ssid may be used. You can expand using a different ssid.

The exported dataset is a tree of nested JSON objects containing like {DID : { link : {data, link : { DID : { link : ... }}}, link : ... }}. The claim itself, is a JSON object that can contain expanded or unexpanded links. unexpanded links contain special values indicating the reason that the link was not expanded which can be eiter:

MAX-DEPTH-REACHED 	: the case in which the given export depth was reached
NOT_FOUND			: the case in which the linked claim could not be found (while the platform seems to be available in a sufficient way)
export-error : the case in which some error occurred (including insufficient rights)

Dependent on the reason, further expansion of the export can be achieved.

```
async exportLD(reference, (depth=3), (ssid=null), (visitedStack=[]))
```

Example export (Note this is from an earlier version):

###	`revoke`
Let's the actor belonging to the given ssid  effectively revoke claims it made earlier. Most times, the platforms revoke through additional claims denoting an earlier claim as being "revoked". You can not rely on effectively revoking such revoke-claims through this method.

```
async revoke(ssid, link)
```

### `subscribe`
Returns a promise with which you can effectively subscribe on the event that a new claim is added to the channel of the given ssids.  
Note not yet implemented

```
async subscribe(ssid)
```
